/** 5. What does the following code log to the console?  */

function scream(words) {
  return words + '!!!!';
}

scream('Yipeee');

// solution = This program also doesn't log anything. The function returns a value, Yipeee!!!!, but it doesn't do anything with it. In particular, it doesn't write it to the console.
