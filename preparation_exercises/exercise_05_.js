// 5. Identify the Constructors for each of the following methods and classify each method as either a "Static" or a "Prototype" method:

// substring
// create
// fromCharCode
// slice
// toString
// It might be that more than one constructor provides a method with a given name.Make sure you list them all in your answer. You can limit your search for methods to the String, Object, Array, and Number constructors.

// substring: constructor = String , method type = Prototype
// create: constructor = Object, method type = Static
// fromCharCode: constructor = String, method type = Static
// slice: constructor = Array, String, method type = Prototype
// toString: constructor = String, Object, Array, Number, method type = Protoype
